Hello I developed a program of adding contacts with react js,
to make it work,

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http: // localhost: 3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

Proje install> 

npm install>
npm start
